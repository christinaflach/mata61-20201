Well, we've come to the end of this video. And to summarize, we looked at regular
expressions, which are used to define regular languages. And the regular
expressions are syntax (that's the expression that we write down), and it
denotes a set of strings which is the regular language and that's the meaning of
the regular expression. And there are five kinds of regular expressions in the
standard definition. There's an expression for the empty string and that's denoted by
epsilon and then we have all the one character strings and then there are three
compound expressions - ways of building new regular expressions from other regular
expressions - and these are union, concatenation, and iteration.
