To summarize, lexical analysis implementation has to do two things. The first
job is to recognize the substrings in the input that correspond to tokens. And
here's a little bit of compiler lingo these substrings are called the lexemes. So
the words of the program are called the lexemes. And then the second job is at for
each lexeme we have to identify its token class. And then the output of the lexical
analyzer is a series of pairs which are the token class. And lexing, Okay, And this
whole thing, one of these pairsis called A token.
